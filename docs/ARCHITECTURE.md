# Sidekik: System Architecture (v0.3.3)

> **Sidekik** is an AI apprentice. It watches an expert work on their screen and asks why at the right moments. It turns that session into a Work Map, then coaches the next hire through the same work on their own screen.
> Hack-Nation 7th Global AI Hackathon, Challenge 01 (ElevenLabs) · Domain: **sidekik.live** (Cloudflare) · Team: **Sahil, Aadil, Mayukh**
> **Source of truth: the `sidekik-docs` repo.** Every code repo carries synced copies in `docs/`, refreshed with `scripts/sync-docs.sh` from sidekik-docs.

---

## 1. How to use these docs

Every repo contains the same set of files, so Claude Code always has full context:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) | Claude Code's entry point. It imports the three files below and sets the repo's rules. |
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | The build spec for **this** repo: endpoints, pipeline, env vars, ordered tickets, definition of done |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | This file: the whole system, contracts (§5 + Appendices A–B), ownership, domains, timeline |
| `docs/SCHEMA.md` | Every table, column and policy |
| `docs/KICKOFF.md` | Copy-paste prompts for the person running Claude Code in this repo |

Two rules:

- **Payload shapes are defined once,** in `sidekik-platform` (the npm package `@sidekik/contracts`). If a doc and the package disagree, the package is correct.
- The `docs/` files in each code repo are **copies**. The source is the `sidekik-docs` repo. Change a doc there by PR (see its `CONTRIBUTING.md`), then run `scripts/sync-docs.sh` to update the code repos.

```

**Model providers:** every LLM and vision call our services make uses the **Claude API** with the team's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, server-side only:
- Haiku 4.5 for vision and fast drafting
- Sonnet 5.5 for building the Work Map

Jev (TypeSafe) is the only other model vendor. The voice agents' LLM runs inside ElevenLabs (see sidekik-voice DESIGN §3). Retrieval uses Postgres full-text search, so there is no embeddings vendor.

**Core design rule:** the ElevenAgents voice session always runs in a browser page. That page is the Capture Room, the Tutor Room, or `/agent-host` running inside the Recall meeting bot. No backend service streams audio. Services decide *what the agent should do* and publish an **agent command**. The gateway forwards each command to the page, and the page tells the agent. Because of this, browser mode and meeting mode share one code path.

## 3. Repos and ownership (3 per person)

| # | Repo | Kind | Owner | Reviewer | Public host | Brief module |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `sidekik-docs` | documentation only: this file, SCHEMA.md, every repo's DESIGN/KICKOFF/CLAUDE.md starters | **all three** | the affected owner | none | all |
| 1 | `sidekik-platform` | npm package (`@sidekik/contracts`) + DB migrations + dev infra + Presidio config | **Sahil** | Mayukh | none | all |
| 2 | `sidekik-perception` | service: frames → screen events, keyframes, clips | **Sahil** | Mayukh | `ingest.sidekik.live` | Capture |
| 3 | `sidekik-brain` | service: Jev decision layer, pause detector, question planner | **Sahil** | Mayukh | private | Capture + Teach |
| 4 | `sidekik-web` | Lovable app: dashboard, rooms, MiniERP, agent-host | **Aadil** | Sahil | `app.sidekik.live` | all UI |
| 5 | `sidekik-voice` | service + ElevenAgents config-as-code | **Aadil** | Sahil | `hooks.sidekik.live` | voice |
| 6 | `sidekik-meetbot` | service: Recall.ai connector | **Aadil** | Sahil | `bot.sidekik.live` | meeting platforms |
| 7 | `sidekik-gateway` | service: public API, sessions, consent, off-record, egress, cost, replay | **Mayukh** | Aadil | `api.sidekik.live` | trust + glue |
| 8 | `sidekik-mapper` | service: Work Map builder, debrief, guardrail compiler, publish | **Mayukh** | Aadil | private | Map |
| 9 | `sidekik-tutor` | service: tutor runtime, rule engine, pre-save check, mastery, MCP | **Mayukh** | Aadil | `mcp.sidekik.live` | Teach |

Each person owns one slice of the product end to end:

- **Sahil, "eyes and judgment":** what is on screen, when to ask, and what to ask. This includes the Jev integration.
- **Aadil, "face and voice":** everything the user sees and hears, including the agents and the meeting bot.
- **Mayukh, "memory and teaching":** sessions and trust, the Work Map, and the tutor.

Reviews rotate: Sahil reviews Aadil, Aadil reviews Mayukh, and Mayukh reviews Sahil. Every PR to `main` needs one approval, and the reviewer is in CODEOWNERS.

### Honest tradeoff

Nine repos for three people in 24 hours means integration is the main risk, more than any single feature. Three rules keep it manageable:

1. **Contracts first.** `@sidekik/contracts@0.1.0` is tagged by H1.5. After that, any payload change needs a version bump and a message in the team chat.
2. **Every service runs alone.** Each one boots against `sidekik-platform/dev/docker-compose.yml` (Redis + Presidio) and recorded bus fixtures, with no dependency on teammates' services.
3. **Three integration checkpoints: H6, H14, H18.** At each one, all three people stop and get the end-to-end path working before continuing (§11).

---

## 4. How services talk

### 4.1 Channels

| Channel | Tech | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Event bus | **Redis Streams** (one stream per event type, one consumer group per service) | everything asynchronous within a session |
| Internal HTTP | private network + `X-Internal-Token` | request/response calls (decide, pre-save check, token, clips) |
| Browser push | **Supabase Realtime broadcast** on channel `session:{sid}`. **Only the gateway publishes to it.** | agent commands to the page |
| Browser → backend | WebSocket to gateway `/ws/client/:sid` (JSON) and a binary WebSocket to perception `/ws/frames/:sid` | turns, speech signals, DOM events, frames |

### 4.2 Streams

| Stream key | Producer(s) | Consumers | Payload type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sk:session.lifecycle` | gateway, meetbot | all services | `SessionLifecycle` |
| `sk:transcript.turns` | gateway (already redacted and off-record filtered) | voice (persists), brain, mapper, tutor | `TranscriptTurn` |
| `sk:speech.signals` | gateway, meetbot | brain, tutor | `SpeechSignal` |
| `sk:dom.events` | gateway | perception | `DomEvent` |
| `sk:screen.events` | perception | brain, tutor, mapper, gateway (replay) | `ScreenEvent` |
| `sk:agent.commands` | perception (`ctx`), brain (`ask`), mapper (`followup`, `teachback`), tutor (`predict`, `intervene`, `replay`, `summary`) | gateway; perception (reads `ask` to keep keyframes around each question) | `AgentCommand` |
| `sk:workmap.published` | mapper | voice, tutor | `WorkMapPublished` |
| `sk:usage` | every service | gateway (cost ledger) | `UsageRecord` |

Each stream is capped with `MAXLEN ~ 10000`. Consumers use `XREADGROUP` with `BLOCK 1000` and acknowledge each entry with `XACK` after handling it. All handlers must be idempotent, keyed on `event.id`. The `bus.ts` helper in `@sidekik/contracts` implements this; services should use it rather than writing their own.

### 4.3 Internal HTTP calls

| Caller → Callee | Endpoint | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| gateway → voice | `POST /internal/token` | 500 ms |
| gateway → meetbot | `POST /internal/bots`, `DELETE /internal/bots/:sid` | 3 s |
| gateway → tutor | `POST /internal/presave` | **300 ms** |
| gateway → mapper | `POST /internal/workmaps/:id/publish`, `GET /internal/workmaps/:id/export`, `POST /internal/tools/recall_context` | 1 s, or async job |
| gateway → tutor | `POST /internal/tools/*` (EL webhook tool proxy) | 800 ms |
| mapper, tutor → brain | `POST /internal/decide` | 600 ms |
| mapper → perception | `POST /internal/clips` | async job |
| mapper → gateway | `POST /internal/sessions/:id/phase` | 1 s |
| brain → gateway | `POST /internal/sessions/:id/off-record` | 200 ms |
| voice → gateway | `POST /internal/redact` (webhook turns) | 300 ms |
| meetbot → gateway | `POST /internal/agent-host-token` | 200 ms |
| meetbot → perception | `WS /internal/frames/:sid` | streaming |
| gateway, perception → Presidio | analyzer / anonymizer / image-redactor | 300 ms |

Request/response schemas for every endpoint above are in `@sidekik/contracts` (`contracts/api.ts`). Shapes marked draft there are for the owning service to confirm.

### 4.4 Auth

| Hop | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| User → gateway | Supabase Auth JWT (`Authorization: Bearer`), verified with `supabase.auth.getUser()` |
| Browser → gateway WS / perception WS | `sk_token`: HS256 with `SK_SESSION_SECRET`, 2 h TTL, claims `{sid, org, role, kind}`, minted by gateway |
| Service ↔ service | `X-Internal-Token: $SK_INTERNAL_TOKEN`; internal routes only accept calls from the private network |
| ElevenLabs post-call webhook → voice | ElevenLabs HMAC signature |
| ElevenLabs webhook tools → gateway | header `X-Sidekik-Tool-Secret`, set in the tool config |
| ElevenLabs MCP → tutor | bearer `SK_TOOL_SECRET` |
| Recall → meetbot | webhook secret + `?secret=` on the realtime WebSocket |
| Recall agent-host page | one-time `t` in the URL, exchanged at gateway `POST /v1/agent-host/claim` for an `sk_token` |

### 4.5 Agent commands: the only way the agent speaks

Services publish commands to `sk:agent.commands`. The gateway checks the off-record state and broadcasts allowed commands to `session:{sid}`. The page then acts:

| `type` | Published by | Page action |
|---|---|---|
| `ctx` | perception | `sendContextualUpdate(text)` (never spoken) |
| `ask` | brain | `sendUserMessage("[SIDEKIK] ASK: <text>")` |
| `followup` | mapper | `sendUserMessage("[SIDEKIK] FOLLOWUP: <text>")` |
| `teachback` | mapper | `sendUserMessage("[SIDEKIK] TEACHBACK: <script>")` |
| `predict` | tutor | `sendUserMessage("[SIDEKIK] PREDICT: <step>")` |
| `intervene` | tutor | `sendUserMessage("[SIDEKIK] INTERVENE: <guardrail + quote>")` + highlight the field |
| `replay` | tutor | open the clip overlay with the expert's quote |
| `summary` | tutor | `sendUserMessage("[SIDEKIK] SUMMARY: …")` + show the mastery panel |
| `offrecord` | gateway | mute mic, show red badge, stop sending frames |
| `phase` | gateway | end the current EL session and start a new one with the token in the payload (capture → debrief) |

While off-record is on, the gateway **drops** every command except `offrecord`.

The database columns behind all of this are in `docs/SCHEMA.md`.

## 6. Data ownership (Supabase, one project)

All tables live in `public` because Lovable reads `public`. Every table has `org_id uuid not null` and RLS enabled. **Each service writes only to its own tables but may read any table.** Migrations live in `sidekik-platform/supabase/migrations`, and CODEOWNERS sends each migration file to its owner for review.

| Owner service | Tables |
|---|---|
| gateway (Mayukh) | `orgs`, `org_members`, `experts`, `learners`, `workflows`, `sessions`, `consent_records`, `off_record_spans`, `cost_ledger`, `replay_events` |
| voice (Aadil) | `transcript_turns`, `agent_configs` |
| meetbot (Aadil) | `meeting_bots` |
| perception (Sahil) | `screen_events`, `keyframes`, `clips` |
| brain (Sahil) | `questions`, `answers`, `decisions_log` |
| mapper (Mayukh) | `work_maps`, `work_map_steps`, `guardrails`, `step_evidence`, `open_items`, `kb_chunks` (full-text search), `expert_memory` |
| tutor (Mayukh) | `learner_attempts`, `interventions`, `mastery`, `gap_flags` |

**Storage buckets** (all private; access only through signed URLs with a 10-minute TTL):

- `captures/org/{org}/sessions/{sid}/keyframes/{t_ms}.webp`
- `captures/org/{org}/sessions/{sid}/clips/{step_id}.mp4`
- `workmaps/org/{org}/{workmap_id}/v{n}/workmap.json | AGENT_RULES.md | guardrails.jsonlogic.json`
- `replays/{sid}/bundle.json`

## 7. Domains and deployment

### 7.1 Cloudflare DNS for `sidekik.live`

| Host | Points to | Proxy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sidekik.live` | redirect rule → `app.sidekik.live` | proxied | landing page later |
| `app` | Lovable custom domain target | **DNS-only** (grey cloud) | follow Lovable's custom-domain steps; Lovable issues its own certificate |
| `api` | gateway | proxied | REST + `/ws/client` WebSocket |
| `ingest` | perception | proxied | binary frames WebSocket |
| `hooks` | voice | proxied | ElevenLabs post-call webhook |
| `bot` | meetbot | proxied | Recall webhooks + realtime WebSocket |
| `mcp` | tutor | DNS-only to start | MCP streaming is simplest without a proxy; switch to proxied once it's verified |

Cloudflare settings and caveats:

- **SSL/TLS:** set the mode to **Full (strict)**.
- **WebSockets:** on (the default).
- **Proxied HTTP times out after 100 s** (error 524). Any call that can take longer, such as the Work Map build, must run as an **async job** with status pushed over Realtime.
- **Proxied WebSockets can drop** when Cloudflare deploys. The page must auto-reconnect with backoff and resume sending from the last `t_ms`.
- **Certificates on a new custom-domain host:** if the host's certificate won't issue, set the record to DNS-only, wait for the certificate, then turn the proxy back on.

### 7.2 Hosting (recommended; the team decides)

- **Railway:** one project named `sidekik` with one service per backend repo, each auto-deploying from `main`.
  - Add the Redis plugin, plus Presidio analyzer, anonymizer and image-redactor as image services.
  - Services reach each other over Railway's private network (`<service>.railway.internal`). Services must listen on `::`.
- **Supabase:** your own Pro project (not Lovable Cloud), connected to Lovable through the Supabase connector before any tables exist.
- **Fly.io** works the same way if you prefer it. Cloudflare Workers can't run `sharp`, `ffmpeg` or Presidio, so the heavy services can't move there. The gateway could, but that isn't worth it this weekend.
- If you want Cloudflare in the data path, Jev is also served on Cloudflare Workers AI (`typesafe/jev`). That makes it a ready fallback provider for brain.

### 7.3 Secrets matrix (✓ = needed)

| Secret | gateway | perception | brain | mapper | tutor | voice | meetbot | web |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | | | | | | | | ✓ |
| `REDIS_URL` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `SK_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| `SK_SESSION_SECRET` | ✓ | ✓ | | | | | | |
| `SK_TOOL_SECRET` | ✓ | | | | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` (+ `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` fallback) | | | ✓ | | | | | |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | | | |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `EL_*_AGENT_ID`, `EL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | | | | | | ✓ | | |
| `RECALL_API_KEY`, `RECALL_REGION`, `RECALL_WS_SECRET` | | | | | | | ✓ | |
| `PRESIDIO_*_URL` | ✓ | ✓ | | | | | | |

Store secrets only in the Railway (or Fly) environment, one shared variable group per environment. **Never put secrets in the Lovable repo**: it only gets the anon key and public URLs.

## 9. Build timeline (24 h)

| Hours | Sahil (platform · perception · brain) | Aadil (web · voice · meetbot) | Mayukh (gateway · mapper · tutor) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0–1.5** | Contracts + `bus.ts` + `auth.ts`, tag `v0.1.0`; docker-compose | Lovable project on own Supabase; auth; org/workflow pages | Migrations + RLS + seed (demo org, Sabine, Lena); Railway project, Redis, DNS |
| **1.5–6** | perception: frame WS, pHash diff, vision benchmark, `screen.events`, `ctx` | voice: both agents pushed, `/internal/token`; web: Capture Room (screen + EL SDK + Realtime handler) | gateway: sessions, `sk_token`, `/ws/client`, Presidio on turns, Realtime egress |
| **H6 ✅** | **Checkpoint 1: browser → frames → event → brain asks → agent speaks a grounded question at a pause** | | |
| **6–10** | brain: D1–D7, planner, off-record D7, `decisions_log`; perception: keyframes + redaction | web: live timeline, consent, off-record UI; voice: post-call webhook, transcript persistence | mapper: builder (Sonnet), validation, open items; gateway: phase API, off-record, consent |
| **10–14** | perception: clips job; brain: `/internal/decide` generic + D6/D8/D12 | web: Work Map page + clip player; voice: KB + Procedures sync on `workmap.published` | mapper: debrief driver, teach-back, publish, JSON-Logic compile + tests |
| **H14 ✅** | **Checkpoint 2: confirmed Work Map, every step with a screen moment and the expert's words** | | |
| **14–18** | brain: D9–D11; perception: tutor-mode tuning | web: Tutor Room + MiniERP pre-save hook + replay overlay | tutor: step tracker, rule engine, `/internal/presave`, predict loop, MCP |
| **H18 ✅** | **Checkpoint 3: €7,200 equipment invoice on opex 4711 caught before save, explained in Sabine's words, clip replayed** | | |
| **18–21** | cost counterfactual, Jev threshold tuning on rehearsal data | meetbot: Recall + Google Meet (**cut if it isn't working by H21**) | mastery + gap flags + export; gateway replay mode + cost ledger |
| **21–24** | Rehearse ×3 · freeze · record replay bundle + backup video · deck | | |

**Cut order if behind:** Teams → meetbot → clips (use keyframes) → image redaction (CSS-blur known fields) → Procedures (use KB + prompt) → MCP (use webhook tools only) → multilingual.

**Never cut:**
- 3 live questions, including one about a guardrail
- a debrief with at least 3 follow-ups and a teach-back
- evidence links for every step and guardrail
- the catch before save

## 10. Conventions (all repos)

- **Stack:**
  - Node 22, TypeScript (strict), Fastify, zod, pino, vitest, and Docker (`node:22-slim`). Node 20 reached end of life in April 2026, and current `@supabase/supabase-js` requires Node ≥ 22.
  - `GET /healthz` returns `{ok, version, deps}`.
- **Repo setup:**
  - `.env.example` lists every variable; `src/env.ts` validates them with zod at boot.
  - `@sidekik/contracts` is pinned to a git tag: `"@sidekik/contracts": "github:sidekik-live/sidekik-platform#v0.1.0"`.
  - Release tags carry a prebuilt `dist/`, so installing runs no build step. pnpm 10 blocks build scripts in git dependencies, which is why the build is prebuilt. Pin tags only; branches have no `dist/`.
  - **Use pnpm 10** (`"packageManager": "pnpm@10.34.6"`). pnpm 9 installs the git dependency under a directory name containing `#`, which Vite (and so vitest) can't load. A lockfile written by pnpm 9 also pins the tag object instead of the commit; pnpm 10 resolves the tag to its commit.
  - If the platform repo is private, add a read-only `NPM_GITHUB_TOKEN` to Railway build variables.
- **Logging:** every log line includes `session_id`, `org_id`, `event_id` (when there is one), and `latency_ms`.
- **Git:**
  - Branches are `feat/<thing>`. Squash-merge to `main`, which deploys.
  - Conventional commits.
  - No one pushes to someone else's `main` without that owner's approval.
- **Testing:** every service ships a `pnpm dev:mock` script that replays `sidekik-platform/dev/fixtures/*.jsonl` onto the bus, so it can be tested without teammates' services running.

## 11. Integration checkpoints and demo fallbacks

- **H6, H14, H18:** all three people join a call, run `sidekik-platform/dev/smoke.sh`, and fix issues before continuing.
- **Demo safety:**
  - The gateway's replay mode (`?replay=<sid>`) re-publishes a recorded session's bus events, so the demo works even if Jev, the vision model or Recall throttles.
  - Keep a pre-confirmed Work Map in the seed data.
  - Record a backup video after the first clean rehearsal.

## Appendix A: Decision specs D1–D12 (canonical; implemented as `DECISION_SPECS` in `@sidekik/contracts`)

Option lists are **alphabetical and fixed**. Every choice question includes a `cannot_tell` or `other` option.

| ID | Used by | Question(s) | Primitive & options | Action rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | brain | `pause_now`, `activity` | Noul + Choice: `cannot_tell, finished_substep, navigating, reading, talking, typing` | ask if ≥0.85 and `finished_substep` ≥0.80 |
| D2 | brain | `event_class` | Choice: `cannot_tell, data_copy, exception_handling, judgment_call, routine_navigation` | only judgment/exception ≥0.80 spawns candidates |
| D3 | brain | `answered_qN`, `value_qN` (≤4 candidates) | Noul + Score 1–4 (visible on screen → pure tacit knowledge) | ask the highest value among those with answered <0.15 |
| D4 | brain | `qtype` | Choice: `exception, limit, other, stop_and_ask, why` | guardrail quota |
| D5 | brain | `content_class`, `has_numeric_or_date_condition` | Choice: `deflection, guardrail_only, neither, reason_and_guardrail, reason_only` + Noul | store the answer; extract the rule if needed |
| D6 | mapper | `specificity`, `refers_to_unknown_entity` | Score 1–4 + Noul | ≤1 or an unknown entity → open item |
| D7 | brain | `off_record_request`, `back_on_record` | Noul ×2, run *after* a regex prefilter (`off the record`, `inoffiziell`, `nicht aufnehmen`, `stop recording`) | ≥0.5 → call gateway off-record |
| D8 | mapper | `teachback_reply` | Choice: `confirmed, confirmed_minor, corrected, unclear` | <0.80 → mapper re-asks |
| D9 | tutor | `prediction_grade` | Choice: `correct_no_reason, correct_with_reason, no_answer, partially, wrong` | attempt outcome |
| D10 | tutor | `divergence` | Choice: `acceptable_variant, cannot_tell, diverges, same_as_expert` | `diverges` ≥0.80 → soft hint |
| D11 | tutor | `intervention_style` | Choice: `hint_soft, intervene_now, wait_and_watch` | a save attempt with a pending violation always intervenes |
| D12 | mapper | `expert_signals_done` | Noul | supports the coverage check |

**Example request (D1):**

```json
{"model":"jev-1.13.0",
 "state":{"features":{"ms_since_speech_end":1850,"ms_since_screen_change":2400,"last_vision_event":"field_changed cost_center 4711→0400","questions_last_10min":1},

 "questions":{
  "pause_now":{"type":"noul","instructions":"Has the expert finished a thought or sub-step so a short question now would not interrupt typing, reading, or a sentence?",
     "criteria":{"true":"Sentence or sub-step ended; screen idle or awaiting a click like Save","false":"Mid-sentence, trailing 'and then', typing, scrolling, or reading"}},
  "activity":{"type":"choice","instructions":"What is the expert doing now?",
     "criteria":{"cannot_tell":"Not enough signal","finished_substep":"Just completed an action, idle or about to confirm","navigating":"Switching screens or records","reading":"Viewing without input","talking":"Explaining without acting","typing":"Entering data"}}}}
```

Check the exact request field names against the current TypeSafe SDK docs before you write `jev.ts`.

## Appendix B: Remaining shared types

```ts
type QType = "exception" | "limit" | "other" | "stop_and_ask" | "why";

type ScreenState = { app?: string; screen?: string; record?: InvoiceState; focused_field?: string };

type MasterySummary = {
  session_id: string; workmap_id: string; learner_id: string;
  steps: { step_id: string; key: string; title: string;
           outcome: "independent_correct" | "prompted_correct" | "corrected_after_intervention" | "not_attempted" }[];
  practice_next: { step_id?: string; guardrail_id?: string; reason: string }[];
  counts: { independent_correct: number; prompted_correct: number; corrected_after_intervention: number; not_attempted: number };
};
```

### Work Map

IDs are UUIDs, and every command and table refers to steps and guardrails by UUID. The `key` fields ("S4", "G1") are human labels for the UI and tests.

```ts
type WorkMap = { id: string; workflow_id: string; expert_id: string; version: number;
  status: "draft"|"in_debrief"|"confirmed"|"published"|"retired";
  title: string; language: string; steps: Step[]; guardrails: Guardrail[]; open_items: OpenItem[];
  confirmed_turn_id?: string };

type Step = { id: string /* uuid */; key: string /* "S4" */; ordinal: number; title: string;            // "Code the invoice to a cost center"
  screen_moment: { t_ms: number; label: string; event_ids: string[]; entity?: string; field?: string };
  decision: string;                                                    // "Re-coded opex (4711) to capex (0400)"
  reason: { quote: string; quote_en?: string; turn_id: string; source_label: string } | null;
  guardrail_ids: string[]; is_judgment_call: boolean;
  screen_signature: { app: string; record_kind: string; field?: string } };

type Guardrail = { id: string /* uuid */; key: string /* "G1" */; kind: "threshold"|"condition"|"stop_and_ask"|"second_approval"|"hold";
  description: string; rule: JsonLogic; consequence: { require?: Record<string,string>; block?: boolean;
  action?: "ask_controller"|"hold"|"second_approval" };
  quote: string; quote_en?: string; evidence: Evidence[] };

type Evidence = { event_id?: string; keyframe_id?: string; clip_id?: string; turn_id: string; t_ms: number };
type OpenItem = { id: string; text: string; anchor_t_ms?: number; origin: "live"|"builder"|"learner_gap";
  status: "open"|"asked"|"resolved" };
```

**Allowed JSON-Logic variables** (normalized `InvoiceState` only): `net_amount, currency, category, supplier, supplier_known, invoice_month, company_code, cost_center, asset_number, approvals_count`.

### Demo guardrails (used by tests in mapper and tutor)

| Key | Rule (plain language) | JSON-Logic sketch | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Equipment over €5,000 is always capex | `{"and":[{">":[{"var":"net_amount"},5000]},{"==":[{"var":"category"},"equipment"]},{"!=":[{"var":"cost_center"},"0400"]}]}` | require cost_center 0400 |
| G2 | No asset number, no capex booking | `{"and":[{"==":[{"var":"cost_center"},"0400"]},{"!":{"var":"asset_number"}}]}` | block |
| G3 | Unknown supplier: stop and ask the controller | `{"==":[{"var":"supplier_known"},false]}` | action ask_controller |
| G4 | Double-billing supplier in December: hold | `{"and":[{"in":[{"var":"supplier"},["Kranbau GmbH"]]},{"==":[{"var":"invoice_month"},12]}]}` | action hold |
| G5 | Czech subsidiary needs a second approval | `{"and":[{"in":["CZ",{"var":"company_code"}]},{"<":[{"var":"approvals_count"},2]}]}` | action second_approval |

The supplier name in G4 is whatever the seed data uses; keep the seed and this table in sync.
